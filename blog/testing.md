# Testing
Fundamentally I believe that Software Engineering is all about leveraging code to deliver value.

And like most nerds, I like to quantify concepts such as value with equations... because then I can optimize them

## Harmozi's Value Equation

value = (Dream_outcome * precieved_probability_of_achievement)/(Time_delay * customer_effort_or_sacrifice)

## So how does testing deliver value
Testing can be used to maximize the value equation in several ways.
### Short term
- If you can demonstrate the core offering as an integration test/unit test it makes demoing the dream_outcome really easy
- Unit tests reduce 

### Long Term
